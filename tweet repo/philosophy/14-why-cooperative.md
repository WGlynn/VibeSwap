Why "cooperative" capitalism and not just capitalism?

Because pure capitalism optimizes for extraction. The winner takes all and the loser takes the loss.

Cooperative capitalism optimizes for value creation. The winner creates value that flows proportionally to everyone who helped create it.

Same engine. Different objective function.
