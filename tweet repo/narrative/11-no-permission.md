Nobody gave us permission to build VibeSwap.

No incubator accepted us. No VC funded us. No foundation granted us.

We just... started building.

121 contracts later, we have a financial operating system that eliminates MEV, distributes rewards fairly, and works on every chain.

Sometimes the best permission is no permission.
