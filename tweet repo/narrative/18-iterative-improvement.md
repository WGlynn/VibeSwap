Session 1: 0 contracts, 0 tests.
Session 5: 30 contracts, 200 tests.
Session 10: 80 contracts, 800 tests.
Session 15: 121 contracts, 1,700 tests.

Every session built on the last. Every bug became a documented pattern. Every failure became a test case.

This is iterative self-improvement. Not a buzzword. A build log you can read on GitHub.
