Zero-sum: I win, you lose.
Negative-sum: we both lose (fees to extractors).
Positive-sum: we both win because no one extracts.

Most of DeFi is negative-sum. You think you're trading against a counterparty but you're actually both losing to MEV bots.

VibeSwap is positive-sum. The value stays with the participants.
