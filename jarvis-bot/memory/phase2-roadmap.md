# Phase 2: Building Out Roadmap

**Full doc**: `C:/Users/Will/vibeswap/docs/roadmap/PHASE2_BUILDING_OUT.md`

## Summary
Phase 2 = 50 additions across 5 categories (10 each):
- Protocol/Framework (intents, pool factory, hooks, keepers, meta-tx, AA, plugins, timelock, POL, versioned proxies)
- Mechanism Design (dutch liquidations, quadratic voting, retroactive funding, conviction voting, bonding curves, commit-reveal governance, harberger tax, prediction markets, MEV redistribution, adaptive batching)
- Aesthetic/UX (achievements, order book viz, inventory, pixel art, GE offers UI, chat, skill tree, SFX, seasonal events, minimap)
- DeFi/DeFAI (concentrated liquidity, AI auto-rebalance, leveraged LP, yield vaults, cross-chain yield routing, limit orders, DCA bot, AI risk scoring, flash loans, perps)
- Financial Primitives (wBAR, LP NFTs, streaming payments, options, yield-bearing stables, bonds, credit delegation, synthetics, insurance derivatives, revenue share tokens)

## Build Order
1. **Financial Primitives** (first — they're the composable legos)
2. Then Protocol/Framework + Mechanism Design
3. Then DeFi/DeFAI features (compose on primitives)
4. Aesthetic/UX (parallel track)

## Current Focus
Starting with Financial Primitives — 10 new contracts/modules.
