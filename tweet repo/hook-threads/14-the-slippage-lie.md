"Set your slippage to 0.5% for best execution."

Translation: accept up to 0.5% theft from MEV bots and we'll still fill your order.

Slippage tolerance is a user-facing knob for how much extraction you're willing to accept.

On VibeSwap there's no slippage knob because there's no extraction to tolerate.
