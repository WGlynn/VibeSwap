Crypto promised meritocracy but delivered plutocracy.

Biggest wallet wins governance. Earliest investor gets best price. Richest trader gets least slippage.

VibeSwap's meritocracy is real:

- Rewards proportional to contribution, not capital
- Quadratic voting prevents whale domination
- Time-neutral distribution treats everyone equally
- Pioneer bonuses reward risk-taking, not wealth

Merit. Not money.
