Traditional finance discriminates by:
- Geography (can't access markets from certain countries)
- Wealth (accredited investor rules)
- Credit history (no score = no service)
- Identity (unbanked = excluded)

VibeSwap discriminates by: nothing.

A phone. Internet. That's the entire requirements list. Same tools for everyone on earth.
