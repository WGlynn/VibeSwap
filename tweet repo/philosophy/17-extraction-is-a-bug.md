Hot take: extraction isn't a feature of capitalism. It's a bug.

Markets work best when value flows to value creators. Extraction diverts value to intermediaries who create nothing.

MEV bots. Payment processors. Rent-seeking gatekeepers.

Remove the extraction and markets work better. For everyone.

That's not anti-capitalist. That's pro-market.
