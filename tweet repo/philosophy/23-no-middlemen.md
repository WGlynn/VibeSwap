Count the middlemen in a traditional stock trade:

Broker. Exchange. Clearinghouse. Custodian. Market maker. Regulator.

Each one takes a cut. Each one adds delay. Each one is a potential point of failure.

VibeSwap middlemen: zero.

Smart contract. Batch auction. Clearing price. Settlement. Done.

The protocol is the exchange, the clearinghouse, and the custodian. And it can't skim.
