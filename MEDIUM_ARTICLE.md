# The DEX Where Your Trade Can't Be Frontrun

## Introducing VibeSwap: 0% Noise. 100% Signal.

---

You've felt it. That moment when you submit a trade and somehow — magically — the price moves against you before execution. The price you saw isn't the price you got.

That's not bad luck. That's extraction.

Every year, traders lose over **$1 billion** to MEV — Maximal Extractable Value. Front-running. Sandwich attacks. Information exploitation. Current DEXs are designed for speed, and speed rewards bots over humans.

The game is rigged. But what if it didn't have to be?

## The Insight

Here's a different way to think about markets:

**Manipulation is noise. Fair price discovery is signal.**

Every front-run trade, every sandwich attack, every informational exploit — these distort the price away from what an asset is actually worth. The "price" you see isn't real. It's the true value plus extraction artifacts.

What if we could remove the noise entirely?

Not discourage exploitation. Not make it harder. **Make it mathematically impossible.**

## How VibeSwap Works

VibeSwap uses batch auctions with commit-reveal ordering. Here's what that means in plain English:

**Your order is hidden.** When you submit a trade, it's encrypted. Nobody — not bots, not validators, not us — can see what you're trading until the batch closes. You can't front-run what you can't see.

**Everyone gets the same price.** All trades in a batch execute at one uniform clearing price. There's no "before" and "after." No sandwich possible when everything happens at once.

**Liquidity is always there.** A passive AMM backstops every trade. No counterparty? No problem. Your trade still executes.

**Flash crashes disappear.** In continuous markets, "panic first" is the rational strategy — you can't beat HFT colocation, so you exit at the first sign of trouble. This causes cascading crashes. In batch auctions, there's no speed advantage. No benefit to panicking. Large selling pressure resolves into one clearing price, not a cascade.

The result? The price you see is the price you get. And that price reflects genuine supply and demand — not who has the fastest bot.

## Why Now?

Three things have changed:

**MEV awareness is mainstream.** Users know they're being extracted. They're actively looking for alternatives. The demand is real.

**Regulatory pressure is building.** MEV extraction looks a lot like front-running — which is illegal in traditional markets. The legal landscape is shifting.

**Infrastructure has matured.** L2s and new L1s can now support batch settlement economically. What was theoretical five years ago is practical today.

## The Opportunity

DEX trading volume exceeds $1 trillion annually. MEV extraction exceeds $1 billion annually. And a growing number of users actively avoid DEXs because of it.

We're not competing for existing DEX users. We're serving the users who left — or never came — because the game was rigged.

## What We're Building

**Phase 1:** MEV-resistant batch auction DEX — the core product.

**Phase 2:** Cross-chain support via LayerZero — trade across chains with the same guarantees.

**Phase 3:** Privacy coin atomic swaps — Monero, Zcash, and more. Trustless, MEV-resistant, cross-chain.

## Why Us?

We understand this problem deeply — not just technically, but philosophically.

Markets are supposed to discover prices. To answer the question: what is this worth? When the mechanism is corrupted, the answer is corrupted. Resources get misallocated. Trust erodes. The whole point of markets breaks down.

We're building markets that work as intended. Where prices reflect value, not exploitation. Where the game rewards participation, not extraction.

**0% noise. 100% signal.**

## Get Involved

We're raising seed funding to complete mainnet deployment, run formal verification audits, bootstrap initial liquidity, and expand the team.

If you believe markets should be fair — actually fair, not just "fair enough" — let's talk.
