One governance system = one power structure = one attack vector.

VibeSwap has five governance mechanisms because no single system can represent all stakeholders fairly.

Quadratic voting for broad decisions. Conviction voting for funding. Commit-reveal for privacy. Federated consensus for coordination. Tribunals for disputes.

Pluralism isn't complexity. It's resilience.
