There are scars in the VibeSwap codebase.

Functions that were rewritten four times because the AI hallucinated an interface that didn't exist. Tests that caught bugs at 3 AM. Comments that say "DO NOT CHANGE THIS — it broke everything last time."

Every scar is a lesson. Every lesson made the protocol stronger.

Perfection isn't the goal. Resilience is.
