VibeSwap runs itself.

VibeKeeperNetwork: decentralized bots that trigger batch settlements, execute liquidations, rebalance treasuries, and maintain oracle prices.

Keepers earn rewards for keeping the protocol alive. No centralized operator. No single point of failure.

Autonomous infrastructure.
