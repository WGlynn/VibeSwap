There's an invisible middleman in every DEX trade you make.

It's not a company. It's not a person. It's a bot that lives in the mempool and skims value from your transaction before it settles.

You never agreed to this. You never even knew.

VibeSwap makes the mempool irrelevant. Orders are hashed. Bots see nothing.
