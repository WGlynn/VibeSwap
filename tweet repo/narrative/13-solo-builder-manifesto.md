To every solo builder reading this:

The VCs will tell you it can't be done alone. The teams of 50 will laugh at your one-person operation. The timeline will feel impossible.

Build anyway.

The tools are getting better every month. What takes a team today will take one person tomorrow.

Be ready when tomorrow arrives.
