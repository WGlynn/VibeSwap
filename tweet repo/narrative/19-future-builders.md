Someday, AI will be Jarvis-level: perfect context, zero hallucinations, autonomous coding.

On that day, the developers who learned to work with primitive AI — managing context, catching hallucinations, building knowledge systems — will have skills nobody else has.

We're not just building VibeSwap. We're training for a future that hasn't arrived yet.

The cave is temporary. The skills are permanent.
