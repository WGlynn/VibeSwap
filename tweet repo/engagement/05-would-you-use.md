Would you use a DEX that:

- Shows you the real price (no hidden MEV tax)
- Gives everyone the same price (uniform clearing)
- Rewards you more for loyalty than for size
- Insures you against impermanent loss
- Works on every chain
- Doesn't require a browser extension

Asking for a friend who built one.
