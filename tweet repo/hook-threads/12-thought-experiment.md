Thought experiment:

What if the stock market worked like current DEXs?

Your broker sees your order, buys ahead of you, sells to you at a higher price, and pockets the difference — every single trade.

You'd call that fraud.

In DeFi, we call it "MEV" and treat it as normal.

It's not normal. We built the alternative.
