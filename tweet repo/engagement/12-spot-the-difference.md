Spot the difference:

Uniswap: you trade → bots extract → you get worse price
VibeSwap: you trade → order hidden → uniform clearing → you get fair price

Aave: deposit 150% → borrow 100% → pray collateral doesn't crash
VibeSwap: Joule stability → deposit 100% → borrow with confidence

Same DeFi. Different architecture. Different outcomes.
