Crypto loves the word "trustless."

But VibeSwap isn't trustless. It's truthful.

The mechanism reveals the true price. The Shapley values reveal true contribution. The commit-reveal reveals true intent.

We didn't remove trust. We replaced it with verifiable truth.

That's a bigger idea than trustlessness.
