Nassim Taleb: "Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio."

VibeSwap's skin-in-the-game principle:

- Commit with a deposit (not just words)
- Conviction voting requires staked tokens over time
- 50% slashing for dishonest reveals
- Pioneer bonuses reward those who take real risk

Talk is cheap. Deposits aren't.
