Building with AI means the AI forgets everything between sessions.

So we built a knowledge base system: contracts catalogue, testing patterns, debugging protocols, iterative learning logs.

Every bug becomes a documented anti-pattern. Every session builds on the last.

The AI doesn't remember. But the knowledge base does.

This might be how all software gets built in 5 years.
