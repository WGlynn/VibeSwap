How VibeSwap Works

VibeSwap is an omnichain decentralized exchange that eliminates MEV — the value extracted from users when validators, searchers, and bots reorder, front-run, or sandwich their transactions. On every major DEX today, the moment you submit a swap, your pending transaction is visible in the mempool. Bots see it, calculate the price impact, and place their own transactions before and after yours to extract profit at your expense. This is not a bug in those systems. It is an inevitable consequence of processing trades one at a time in a visible queue. VibeSwap replaces that model entirely with commit-reveal batch auctions that settle all orders at a single uniform clearing price.

The mechanism runs in three phases on fixed time windows. During the commit phase, users submit a cryptographic hash of their order along with a token deposit. The hash conceals every detail of the trade — token pair, direction, amount, and a user-generated secret — so no observer can determine what the order actually is. This is not encryption that a sophisticated actor could break. It is a one-way hash. The only way to learn the order contents is for the user to reveal them in the next phase. Front-running becomes impossible because there is nothing to front-run. The orders are invisible.

During the reveal phase, users broadcast their original order parameters and their secret. The contract verifies that each reveal hashes to the corresponding commit. Invalid reveals — where the hash does not match — result in the user's deposit being slashed by 50%, which makes griefing and spam economically self-punishing. Once all valid orders are collected, the protocol settles the batch. It computes a single uniform clearing price from the aggregate supply and demand curves, shuffles execution order using a deterministic Fisher-Yates algorithm seeded by the XOR of all user secrets, and fills every order at the same price. There is no advantage to being first, last, or anywhere in between. Sandwich attacks are structurally impossible because every participant receives identical pricing.

VibeSwap operates on top of a constant-product AMM (x*y=k) with protocol-owned liquidity pools, TWAP oracles for price validation, and circuit breakers that halt trading if volume, price deviation, or withdrawal rates exceed safety thresholds. Cross-chain swaps are handled natively through LayerZero V2's messaging protocol, meaning users on different chains commit to the same batch auction without bridging tokens first. The protocol validates price integrity by checking that the clearing price does not deviate more than 5% from the time-weighted average price, which prevents oracle manipulation and stale-price exploitation. Rate limiting caps individual throughput to prevent any single actor from dominating a batch.

The result is a DEX where the price you see is the price you get, regardless of how much you are trading or who else is trading alongside you. MEV is not mitigated or reduced — it is eliminated by design at the mechanism level. There is no mempool to snipe, no transaction ordering to exploit, no price impact to sandwich. The protocol aligns incentives so that the optimal strategy for every participant is simply to submit their honest order and wait for settlement. VibeSwap does not ask users to trust that bots will behave or that validators will be fair. It makes extraction structurally impossible, which is a fundamentally different security guarantee than anything available on existing DEX infrastructure.
