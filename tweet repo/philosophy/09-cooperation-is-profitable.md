The biggest lie in finance: greed is the engine of markets.

The truth: cooperation is more profitable than extraction when the system is designed correctly.

VibeSwap proves it. LPs earn more because MEV isn't being siphoned. Traders pay less because nobody's front-running them.

Everyone profits. Nobody extracts.
