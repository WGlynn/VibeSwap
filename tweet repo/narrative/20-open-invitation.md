VibeSwap isn't finished. It might never be "finished."

But it's open. The code is public. The contribution graph is live. The forum is active.

If you believe finance should be fair, open, and cooperative — there's a place for you here.

Write code. Report bugs. Share ideas. Challenge our assumptions.

Every contribution is recorded. Every contributor is rewarded.
