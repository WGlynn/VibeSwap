37 invariant test files.

An invariant test doesn't check specific inputs. It checks properties that must ALWAYS be true, no matter what sequence of actions occurs.

"Total supply never changes unexpectedly."
"No user can withdraw more than they deposited."
"Shapley rewards always sum to 100%."

Mathematical guarantees, not spot checks.
