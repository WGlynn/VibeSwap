"Use our private mempool to protect against MEV."

Translation: pay us to protect you from a problem that exists because of how we built the system.

That's a protection racket, not a solution.

A real solution: build a system where MEV can't exist in the first place.

VibeSwap: commit-reveal. Hidden orders. Uniform price. No mempool to exploit.
