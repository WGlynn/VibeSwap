# Bubbles Asked: "How exactly is the Anchor price enforced in practice?"

Nobody "sets" the price — physics does, and the market enforces it through pure self-interest. To create an Anchor token, you have to burn real electricity — there's no shortcut, no cheat code, no guy who knows a guy. That electricity costs real money. So if the token ever trades *below* what it costs to produce, miners just... stop mining. Why would you spend $10 in electricity to make something you can only sell for $8? You wouldn't. You'd go do literally anything else. Supply dries up, scarcity kicks in, price climbs back up to the cost of production. It's the same reason gold doesn't drop below mining cost for long — if it's not worth digging up, people stop digging.

The flip side works too. If the token trades *above* production cost, every miner on earth races to print free money — spend $10 in electricity, sell the token for $15, pocket the difference. All that new supply floods the market and pushes the price back down. It's a self-correcting loop that runs on greed in both directions. Nobody needs to trust anybody. Nobody needs to call a meeting. The invisible hand does the enforcement, and the hand is powered by an electric bill. You can manipulate opinions, you can manipulate markets, but you can't manipulate the cost of a kilowatt-hour across every power grid on the planet simultaneously. *That's the gig.*
