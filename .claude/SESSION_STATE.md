# Session State — 2026-04-18

## Block Header
- **Session**: Autopilot mode — full autonomy grant from Will, run indefinitely with continuation protocols until REBOOT threshold. Big-small rotation.
- **Branch**: `feature/social-dag-phase-1`
- **Commits today**: `5467576d` Persistence Layer doc → `c4b91357` Radical Transparency section → `bc1bf2bf` Rate of Revelation section → `125b01fb` Oracle C12 ship (EvidenceBundle + IssuerReputationRegistry, 10 files +1083 LOC) → `6063dc74` SESSION_STATE + WAL refresh → `8cb1d7c7` C20 test deltas (refund-requested, per-token isolation, counter fuzz) → `bb2d18d9` R3 delivery package doc.
- **Status**: C12 shipped, tested, documented. R3 tuple is `docs/oracle-c12-r3-delivery.md` (`bb2d18d9`) — single markdown Will can hand to the reviewer. All work committed + pushed to origin.

## Completed This Session

### Persistence Layer Doc (3 commits)
Philosophical doc distilled from conversation: scars→substrate, AFK cost corollary, DAG gives credit, radical transparency (incentive-compatible openness), rate of revelation (speed = velocity of disclosure, not volume), the ledger, persistence layer as civilization's first knowledge-compound mechanism. Pushed to `DOCUMENTATION/THE_PERSISTENCE_LAYER.md`.

### Oracle Cycle 12 — BIG loop
External-audit-gated work closed. Full design authority exercised on 6 open questions (see `memory/project_oracle-audit-rounds.md` R3 section for lock-ins). Shipped:
- **IssuerReputationRegistry**: standalone contract with stake bonding, permissioned slashing, penalty-only reputation with time-based mean-reversion (MID=5000bps, half-life=30 days), 7-day unbond delay (anti-slash-dodge property preserved).
- **EvidenceBundle struct**: version + stablecoinContextHash + issuerKey fields added to EIP-712 signature surface. Fabrication of any field invalidates signature.
- **TruePriceOracle.updateTruePriceBundle**: legacy path preserved; new path validates version, context hash, issuer ACTIVE, signer binding, nonce, deadline.
- **ISocialSlashingTier stub**: enabled=false default; activation deferred to C13+ via DAO.

### Lineage project — new standalone repo, E2E backend (NDA-counterparty-sprint parallel track)
After Oracle C12 shipped, Will asked for an E2E backend based on the Justin-intake A-3 product ("persistence layer for the how of professional knowledge work"). Stood up at `C:/Users/Will/lineage/` — FastAPI + SQLModel + SQLite, runs without infrastructure.

**Four shipped cycles on Lineage (local only, no remote)**:
1. **Phase 1 MVP** (`initial`): Decision / Evidence / lineage DAG — the *why* layer. 6 E2E tests.
2. **Phase 2 substrate** (`substrate:`): Semantic + Artifact + CompileAgent + Translation + TestVector — the *what* layer. Rosetta framing (three-projection metaphor from the Stone). +5 tests.
3. **Phase 2 execution** (`phase 2:`): translator adapters (StubTranslator / ClaudeTranslator / GeminiTranslator), verification runners (Python exec + C gcc/subprocess). +7 tests.
4. **Phase 3 sketch** (`docs: Phase 3 CKB sketch`): architectural doc mapping CKB cells + VibeSwap primitive reuse.
5. **Code-as-Coordination thesis** (`docs: Code as Coordination`): L1/L2 mechanism design mapping, transliteration constraint, GIL as L2 property, CKB VM native parallelism, HPy bridge ABI, Matt's PoW locks.
6. **Trusted Private Mode** (`trusted mode:`): dual-deployment enforcement. TRUSTED (web2, log-only slashing) vs OPEN (web3, full slashing) via `LINEAGE_TRUST_MODE` env var. Same data model, different enforcement policy. +3 tests, all 20 green.

**PDF on Desktop**: `2026-04-18_Code_As_Coordination_v2.pdf` (70KB) — the thesis Will will forward to Justin for the Gemini-vs-Claude comparison.

**NDA gate incident (mid-session)**:
- NDA gate caught NDA-counterparty/counterparty-brand-B/counterparty-brand-C proper nouns in `docs/CODE_AS_COORDINATION.md` during `git add`
- Current HEAD of lineage repo is clean (redacted in commit `f0507e0`)
- **Prior commit `d247a17` (local only, no remote push) still contains the NDA-counterparty content in git history**
- **OPEN QUESTION FOR WILL**: rewrite local lineage history to scrub `d247a17`? Requires explicit approval — destructive operation. Current state: NDA-counterparty material exists only in Will's local `.git/objects`, not published anywhere.

## Pending / Next Session

### R3 delivery — hand-off ready
`docs/oracle-c12-r3-delivery.md` (commit `bb2d18d9`) contains the complete R3 tuple: what C12 closes, file manifest, evidence-bundle spec, IssuerReputationRegistry mechanics, six locked design decisions with rationale, upgrade-path analysis, test evidence, open questions for reviewer. Will can forward this doc directly — no assembly required. Reviewer's R2 expectation: primitive graduates to "deployable" status after R3 passes.

### Known debt (not C12 scope)
Pre-existing 48 failing tests in `test/TruePriceValidation.t.sol` (DonationAttackDetected vs. TruePriceFeeSurcharge ordering). AMM-side, unrelated to C12. Not blocking ship — noted in C12 commit. Investigation deferred.

### Next-session candidate loops
- C13 scope (oracle-side, if reviewer flags additional gaps in R3)
- Density scan: access-control audit of admin setters across recent contracts (rare fresh-code opportunity after C12 ship)
- C12-AUDIT-2 HIGH — slashed stakes orphaned in VibeAgentConsensus (slash destination) — from RSI backlog
- Operator-cell assignment layer — HIGH (C11-AUDIT-14 follow-up) — from RSI backlog
- Investigation: pre-existing DonationAttack failures in TruePriceValidation.t.sol (might be one-line helper fix, might be 48-test refactor)

### Follow-ups (from 2026-04-17)
See prior session block below.

# Session State — 2026-04-17

## Block Header
- **Session**: Full Stack RSI cycles C21-C24. C21 primitive extraction (Settlement State Durability). C22 UUPS storage/upgrade scan — 1 systemic MEDIUM + 1 architectural deferred. C23 batch fix — 125 contracts patched with `_disableInitializers()`. C24 unbounded-loop DoS scan — 1 HIGH + 2 MED (F1+F2 fixed same-cycle, F3 deferred), Phantom Array Antipattern primitive extracted. Four cycles shipped in one day. Justin daily-report habit established as standing convention. MIT Lawson two-layer pitch sharpened (separate side-quest).
- **Branch**: `feature/social-dag-phase-1`
- **Commits today**: `53e3a7a1` (C21+C22 memory + C23 batch fix, 128 files), plus this commit (C24 fixes + tests + memory).
- **Status**: 4 cycles shipped. Six distinct RSI cycle types demonstrated. Justin daily report up-to-date through C23 (C24 append pending).

## Completed This Session

### RSI Cycle 21 — Primitive Extraction: Settlement State Durability (memory-only)
### RSI Cycle 22 — UUPS Storage/Upgrade Safety Scan (memory-only; 1 systemic MEDIUM)
### RSI Cycle 23 — `_disableInitializers()` Batch Fix (125 contracts, commit `53e3a7a1`)

### RSI Cycle 24 — Unbounded Loop / DoS Density Scan + F1/F2 Fixes + Phantom Array Primitive

**R1 Audit**: 3 real findings, 5 FPs triaged, 6 designed-loops confirmed clean.

- **C24-F1 HIGH FIXED**: NakamotoConsensusInfinity `validatorList` DoS. Permissionless `advanceEpoch` → `_checkHeartbeats` iterated unbounded array. Fix: swap-and-pop helper `_removeFromValidatorList`, called from all 3 deactivation sites (deactivateValidator, slashEquivocation, _checkHeartbeats), plus `MAX_VALIDATORS = 10_000` cap + `MaxValidatorsReached` error.
- **C24-F2 MED FIXED**: CrossChainRouter `_handleBatchResult` + `_handleSettlementConfirm` unbounded on attacker-supplied commit hash arrays. Fix: `MAX_SETTLEMENT_BATCH = 256` cap + `BatchTooLarge` error in both handlers.
- **C24-F3 MED DEFERRED**: HoneypotDefense `trackedAttackers` — same Phantom Array class, view-only materialization, queued to RSI backlog.

**Tests** (+7): 4 NCI C24-F1 + 3 CCR C24-F2. All green. Regression: 56/56 NCI + 49/49 CCR.

**R2 Primitive Extracted**: **Phantom Array Antipattern** (`memory/primitive_phantom-array-antipattern.md`). Three instances found in one scan → strong n-of justification. Added to MEMORY.md under Integration Primitives.

**MIT Side-Quest**: Two-layer Lawson pitch written + PDF'd to `Desktop/MIT_Lawson_TwoLayer_Pitch.pdf`. Reframes Lawson Floor as *distribution layer only*, pairs it with *novelty-weighted Shapley on process evidence* as the judging layer. Closes the gap Will sensed in the original pitch.

## Pending / Next Session

### Append C24 to today's Justin report
Current file covers C20/C21/C22/C23. Need C24 append (3 real findings, 2 fixes shipped, 1 primitive extracted, regression-clean).

### RSI Backlog (architectural — needs Will's design call)
- **C12-AUDIT-2 HIGH** — slashed stakes orphaned in VibeAgentConsensus (slash destination)
- **Operator-cell assignment layer** — HIGH (C11-AUDIT-14 follow-up)
- **C22-D1** — NCI `reinitializer(2)` pre-deploy gate
- **C24-F3 MED** — HoneypotDefense trackedAttackers Phantom Array
- **VibeAgentOrchestrator._activeWorkflowIds** — Phantom Array class, design call on compaction strategy
- **C7-GOV-008 MED** — stale oracle bricks VibeStable liquidation

### C25 candidates
- Quick F3 fix (templated from F1's helper) as systemic-batch completion
- Another fresh density class (signature replay, events completeness, front-running in public mempool ops)
- One of the HIGH backlog items when Will returns

### Follow-through
- MIT consulting: two-layer pitch sent (waiting on response)
- Claude-code PR #48714
- Soham Rutgers feedback
- Tadija DeepSeek round 2
