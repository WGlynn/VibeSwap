The public goods problem: things that benefit everyone get funded by no one.

VibeSwap's solution: make public goods privately profitable.

Provide liquidity? Private reward (fees). Contribute code? Private reward (Shapley). Report bugs? Private reward (points).

Every public contribution has a private incentive. The commons doesn't rely on charity.
