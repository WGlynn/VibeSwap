Your last swap on Uniswap:

- You saw a price
- You submitted a transaction
- A bot saw your tx in the mempool
- It front-ran you
- Your price moved
- You got filled worse
- The bot sold immediately for profit

You didn't notice. That's the point.

VibeSwap orders are invisible until settlement. Every. Single. One.
