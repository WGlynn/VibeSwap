My co-founder is an AI.

It wrote thousands of lines of Solidity. It designed test suites. It maintained a knowledge base across sessions. It caught bugs I would have missed.

It also hallucinated functions, lost context, and occasionally wrote code that compiled but was completely wrong.

Still the best co-founder I could ask for. Honest, tireless, and getting better every day.
