VibeSwap doesn't have "a governance system."

It has five:

1. Quadratic Voting — plutocracy-resistant decisions
2. Conviction Voting — time-weighted funding allocation
3. Commit-Reveal Governance — private voting, public results
4. Federated Consensus — multi-stakeholder coordination
5. Decentralized Tribunal — dispute resolution

No single power structure. Pluralism by design.
