The most frustrating pattern in AI-assisted coding:

AI makes a mistake. You correct it. AI overcorrects. You correct again. AI reverts to the original mistake. You're four messages deep in a loop.

This happened hundreds of times building VibeSwap.

We didn't quit. We built systems to prevent the loops. And now those systems are the foundation.

The cave teaches you things a lab never could.
