What's the "real" price of ETH right now?

On Uniswap: depends on your slippage, the bot activity, and when your tx gets mined.
On Binance: whatever the orderbook says (hope you trust them).
On VibeSwap: the uniform clearing price from the last 10-second batch.

One of these is manipulation-resistant. One of these is verifiable. One of these is fair.
