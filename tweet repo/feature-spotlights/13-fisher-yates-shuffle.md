How do you order trades fairly when everyone submits at once?

Fisher-Yates shuffle, seeded with XORed trader secrets + block entropy.

No single party controls the order. No one can predict it. Provably random, cryptographically verified.

Fair sequencing isn't a promise. It's math you can verify on-chain.
