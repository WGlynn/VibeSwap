Financial literacy shouldn't be a prerequisite for financial access.

You don't need to understand TCP/IP to use the internet. You don't need to understand combustion to drive a car.

You shouldn't need to understand MEV, slippage, and impermanent loss to swap currencies.

VibeSwap handles the complexity. You handle your money.
