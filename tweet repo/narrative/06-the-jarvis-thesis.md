Today's AI loses context mid-conversation and hallucinates function names.

Tomorrow's AI will autonomously maintain entire codebases.

The patterns we develop now — knowledge bases, session protocols, self-improvement logs — become the foundation when AI goes from intern to Jarvis.

We're not just building VibeSwap. We're building the future of human-AI development.
