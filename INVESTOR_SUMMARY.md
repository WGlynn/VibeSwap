# VibeSwap — Investor Summary

**The DEX where your trade can't be frontrun.**

---

## The Problem

Every day, traders lose **$1B+ annually** to MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) — front-running, sandwich attacks, and information exploitation. Current DEXs are designed for speed, which rewards bots over humans.

The price you see isn't the price you get. The difference goes to extractors.

## The Insight

**Manipulation is noise. Fair price discovery is signal.**

What if we removed the noise entirely? What if the mechanism made exploitation mathematically impossible — not just discouraged, but structurally eliminated?

## The Solution

VibeSwap uses **batch auctions with commit-reveal ordering** to guarantee fair execution:

- Orders are hidden until a batch closes (no front-running)
- All trades in a batch execute at one uniform price (no sandwich attacks)
- Passive AMM liquidity ensures trades always execute (no counterparty risk)

**Result:** The clearing price reflects genuine supply and demand — not who has the fastest bot.

## Why Now

1. **MEV awareness is mainstream** — Users know they're being extracted. They want alternatives.
2. **Regulatory pressure** — MEV extraction looks a lot like front-running, which is illegal in traditional markets.
3. **Infrastructure maturity** — L2s and new L1s can now support batch settlement economically.

## Traction

- Complete mechanism design and smart contract architecture
- Security audit completed (15 issues identified and fixed)
- Testnet deployment in progress
- Active community engagement on Nervos Network (CKB integration)

## The Opportunity

| Market | Size |
|--------|------|
| DEX trading volume | $1T+ annually |
| MEV extracted | $1B+ annually |
| Users actively seeking MEV protection | Growing rapidly |

We're not competing for existing DEX users. We're serving users who currently **avoid DEXs** because of MEV.

## What We're Building

- **Phase 1:** MEV-resistant batch auction DEX (core product)
- **Phase 2:** Cross-chain support via LayerZero
- **Phase 3:** Privacy coin atomic swaps (Monero, Zcash)

## The Ask

Seed funding to:
- Complete mainnet deployment
- Security audits (formal verification)
- Initial liquidity bootstrapping
- Team expansion (1-2 engineers)

## Why Us

We understand the problem deeply — not just technically, but philosophically. We're building markets that work as intended: where prices reflect value, not exploitation.

**0% noise. 100% signal.**
