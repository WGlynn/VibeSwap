Traditional finance is zero-sum: my gain is your loss.

DeFi was supposed to fix this but just moved the extraction on-chain.

VibeSwap is actually positive-sum: eliminating MEV means value that was being extracted now stays with traders and LPs.

The pie doesn't just get split differently. It gets bigger.
